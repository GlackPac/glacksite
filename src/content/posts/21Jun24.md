In an effort to try and chill out more, I'm gonna be less therap-esque in these posts. Tried journaling for a year and a bit so I'll make this something different. More of a chat. If I'm in a patient mood, a well-written chat.

Checked out a lot of Montreal staples today. Climbed Mont Royal, went to St Viateur's bagels, bought some (pants) at jeans jeans jeans. Also, saw cirque du soleil live. What a god damn good show, full of attactive, talented people. They had a banjo, cello, violin and vocals playing live throughout. Guy had a killer violin solo after the intermission. I wanna be that good.

Family dinner after the fact was a bit glum. In an effort to eat healthy we're dodging most restraunts and landing on the places with salad-y type dishes. That and our usual icy-cold dinner repartee makes it stifling. Penne had a rich and interesting red sauce, so it kinda balances out.

Been neglecting drawing for a little bit. Ideally, the gallery module would've been quick and easy to implement yesterday. Got distracted trying to be thorough and learning how my code actually works, and fixing bugs in the process. Will start a few boxes on the 250 box challenge tomorrow though.
