Well, there goes my post streak. I've been trying not too put off drawing too much, so I gave the site a rest in favour of drawing while staying in Quebec city. Nice place! Heavily tourist focused. Did a lot of the tourist stuff, like visit Montmorency falls and walk around old Quebec. Was not expecting to enjoy it more than Montreal.

I had a proper poutine too. My first poutine was at a vegan restaurant. It had vegan cheese chunks instead of curds, and potato cubes instead of fries. I didn't finish it. Taste being a small-factor in that. The poutine two nights back was made a-la normally, but made fancy with roast duck. Averaging between them, I can say I've had poutine. Kind of like a budget HSP, and much more filling. A good meal for post Ramadan.

Got stuck into the 250 box challenge from [Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/lesson/250boxes/2) again. I had given it a shot back in late 2022, got to about 72 and then stopped drawing for 2 years. Now I'm back at it, and hoping to finish.

As for the site, I've been snooping for improvements. I don't like the header or colours, so expect changes there. For now, I'm off to bed in a giant hotel room.
