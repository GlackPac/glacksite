Jetlag's kicking in, so rushing this one out before I nod off. Back home after an almost month-long holiday. Was refreshing and coming back to Perth has been bittersweet. Travelling really highlights how plain and empty the city is compared to anywhere in Canada. May be that the grass is measurably greener in Canada, or I'm just used to Perth.

Either way, It's time to get to work. Plenty of stuff I'd put off till getting back (exercise, coding, drawing). Now that I'm here, Its time to get a routine going. Aiming to get shredded, draw real good birds, and have a good familiarity with web design. Next week I'll need to start putting my Resume in places as well. My money can only burn in so many spots at once.

Playing around with placeholder images on the site. Current method uses the [@unpic library](https://unpic.pics/img/astro/) to easily scale images on the site as well as create a placeholder gradient. It uses a library called Blurhash, which I've pointed at a particular image. Local images make it hard to setup without an island perhaps, so I'll investigate that later. Is ok for now though.

Seeing as this is a checkpoint I'll update art too. Got 50/250 cubes done while overseas and should do some sketching before kicking off into more. Plenty of birds I'd like to sketch from Canada. I'll compile a list and try my hand at sketching them.

Sport wise, I won't go too nuts. Jog in the morning + some light yoga + push-ups. Will ease into more intense stuff as I get used to it.
