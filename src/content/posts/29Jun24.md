Bizarre vibes in Edmonton. It feels stuck in the 90s/early 00s. A lot of aggregate concrete, red-brick, wide roads and people with long, wide jeans. A more tame version of mid-west America maybe. People are quite friendly here too. Experienced more warmth from two servers here, than the sum total of everyone in Perth. The place is great for me though, I love the late 90s aesthetic of games and early CG and this town feels like a too-real VR tour of Myst or Half-Life 1. Had the Denny's Grand SlamÂ® which was pretty great too. Those shredded hashbrowns rule.
