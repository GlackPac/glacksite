More site work. Added a logo to click for home page which took a few hours. Had to decouple the CSS from different elements to get it looking ok. Using a few sites as reference, as CSS is a nest of different options. The logo looks bad, and will need replacing. Gonna explore astro and Obsidian docs tomorrow though and see what I can play with.

I'm taking the days we're in apartments for web design, and hotel days for drawing. Bedrooms don't have desk space for drawing and I don't want to draw in the shared rooms when I'm still at a diaper baby level.

Holiday wise, saw Lake Louise and had a great time. Got my Canadian hiking fix I'd been hankering for. Took some good snaps and enjoyed the sights thoroughly. Finished up with some great Indian food and a pastry called a beaver-tail. A donut with a canvas for sauces and sweet stuff. Love donuts, and this was twice as good.
