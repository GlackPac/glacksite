Hey all. Done some major work on the site recently. Posts are now handled with [Astro's content collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-content-collections/). With it in place, I'm able to remove the .mdx files that were in place previously, and return them to being .md files. Image processing is done externally and is fed properly thanks to the image wrapper of content collections. All in effort to make code re-usable.

Was also intending to use it as a way of creating a gallery component for a future project. But many things broke in the process of tweaking this, so most of the work recently has been fixing all that. Today kind of sucked in general, chafe rashes, a suffocating family dinner and all the hassle of this site piled up. As of writing tomorrow morning (kind of cheating here), I've managed to make good progress on all three. Feeling motivated.
