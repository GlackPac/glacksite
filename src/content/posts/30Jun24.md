The west Edmonton mall is stupid big. One can find a galleon, sea lion display, ice rink, water park, amusement park (sponsored by Hasbro), a food court with every cuisine you can think of plus extras for all the Canadian/American chains as well as maybe 300 stores. It has three different stores for wedding dresses. 

Some very talented tweens were playing a game of ice hockey when we visited. They were strong ice skaters and puck smackers. I'm not a sports guy, and they made me want to start watching ice hockey. The last time that happened was watching a football match live in Italy, with two of the largest teams of the region.

Driving through the Rockies after was surreal. Those mountains sure are pretty. The cloud cover would create pockets of shadow that made the small amount of snow on the peaks pop-out in contrast. It's impossible not to have a good view when looking around. The mountains are geologically diverse and everywhere. And big. The bug-smacked windscreen and crappy Samsung Galaxy A52s camera do not do them justice. Chance for better shots tomorrow. The rain surrounding our hotel look like grey wisps coasting over the mountains. A greyscale borealis.

Collated some more notes. Got a lot of recommends to go through when I have access to a desktop and some time.
