Been making work on the site more. Flicking away parts of the astro tutorial I don't need and setting up a good blog pipeline for the future. Been really enjoying digging into it so far, been feeling new drives that I've not felt previously. Been feeling more in general today. Always a good thing.

Perks of the new system is that I can now put images on these blog posts easier thanks to a quick and dirty component and .mdx files. Hello ducky!

While I'd like to write more about today (It was good!) I'll save it for tomorrow, as re-tooling it took a while and I don't want to keep my house hosts up while travelling. Excited to tinker tomorrow though.
